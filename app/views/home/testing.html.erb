	<h2 style="color:green;text-align:center;"><i>About the Seeds Game</i></h2>
		<p> Seeds is a casual social-mobile game that revolves around growing a citadel 
		for a family of fantasy creatures called seedlings, each of whom develops complex 
		and unique personalities through their interactions with the player, their home, 
		and one another. Players can decorate the seedlingsâ€™ home and the seedlings 
		themselves, as well as govern the actions of the seedlings through an intuitive 
		interface. Each seedling is a unique individual unlike the seedlings that belong 
		to other players. The player will witness the lives of many of their seedlings 
		from birth, and watch as their group flourishes. Users will be able to expand the 
		citadels, purchase and add new pieces of furniture, and interact with the 
		seedlings. As users progress through the game, accomplish missions, and gain more 
		levels the world opens up more with more floors and seedlings. </p>
